### Core Components

https://reactnative.dev/docs/components-and-apis

Some things require special care in order to work on both iOS and Android. For these things, we need to add two different pieces of code so that the app looks and works similarly on both platforms. 
This might include : 
- Core Components
- Styling Properties for Core Components
- API's to access system level things like sensor data 

Add these kinds of things to the list below and use this list as your guide.
